# Brain-Tumour-Detection-with-CNN

Overview

Brain health is paramount, and timely detection of brain abnormalities like tumors is crucial. This project aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately detect the presence of tumors in brain MRI images.

Project Objective

The primary goal is to develop a robust CNN model capable of categorizing brain MRI images into two categories: 'tumor' or 'no tumor.' The project evolves through various stages:

Baseline Model: Initiating with a foundational CNN model.

Data Augmentation: Expanding the dataset through augmentation techniques.

Understanding Brain Tumors

Brain tumors comprise abnormal cell growth within the brain, categorized as benign or malignant. They can originate within the brain or metastasize from other body parts. The growth rate and location significantly impact nervous system function and treatment strategies.

Dataset

The dataset comprises brain MRI images classified into two categories: tumors and non-tumors. The goal is to train the model to accurately classify these images.
